# Risks

Quartz protocol is experimental and is provided to you "as is". Quartz uses a smart contract to manage user funds. The code for this smart contract is available [here](https://github.com/quartz-labs/quartz-app/). If a hack were to occur, this could pose a risk to user funds. However, user deposits are not stored in the Quartz smart contract and are instead deposited directly with integrated dApps, reducing the attack surface and risk.

If any of these dApps were to be hacked, there could be a loss of user funds. While Quartz monitors and attempts to safeguard against possible compromises, there is no guarantee that Quartz will be able to save or recover user funds if an exploit does occur. All the dApps we integrate are open source, audited, and backed by reputable teams and investors.

Any use will be at your own risk and without warranties by Quartz of any kind.
