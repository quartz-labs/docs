# Privacy Policy

This is the privacy policy of Quartz, (‘we’, ‘our’, or ‘us’). This policy describes how we collect, store, transfer and use personal data. It tells you about your privacy rights and how the law protects you.

In the context of the law and this policy, ‘personal data’ is information that clearly identifies you as an individual or which could be used to identify you if combined with other information. Acting in any way on personal data is referred to as ‘processing’.

This policy applies to personal data collected through this website and through social media platforms. We do not share, or sell, or disclose any of your personal data to a third party.

If you have any questions about how we process your personal data, including any requests to exercise your legal rights, please contact [iarla@quartzpay.io](mailto:iarla@quartzpay.io)

## Personal data we process

When you fill out this website’s waitlist form, we ask you to provide your email address, country of residence, and first name.

When you use our [web app](https://app.quartzpay.io/) or mobile app, we track functional data (such as error logs), and associate this data only with your connected crypto wallet address. This information is used strictly to improve our products and services, and is stored securely in the European Union.

We may aggregate anonymous information such as statistical or demographic data for any purpose. Anonymous information is that which does not identify you as an individual. Aggregated information may be derived from your personal data but is not considered as such in law because it does not reveal your identity. We never collect personal information without your consent.

## How and when we process your personal data

We do not share, or sell, or disclose any of your personal data to a third party. Any personal data collected is securely stored by Quartz.

We use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) certificates to verify our identity to your browser and to encrypt any data you give us. Whenever information is transferred between us, you can check that it is done so using SSL by looking for a closed padlock symbol or other trust mark in your browser’s URL bar or toolbar.

## Use of this website by children

This website is intended only for those over the age of 18. We do not sell products or provide services for purchase by children, nor do we market to children. Any personal information collected is collected under the assumption that you are over the age of 18.

## Your rights

The law requires us to tell you about your rights and our obligations to you in regard to the processing and control of your personal data. We do this now, by requesting that you read the information provided at https://www.knowyourprivacyrights.org

At any time, you may contact us to request that we provide you with the personal data we hold about you. If you wish to be removed from the waitlist, or wish for any of your personal data to be deleted, please contact us with the email address you used when providing us with your personal data. We will remove your personal data as soon as possible once we receive your request.

If you are not happy with our privacy policy, or if you have any complaint, please contact us. When we receive a complaint, we record the information you have given to us on the basis of consent. We use that information to resolve your complaint.

To contact us for any of the above reasons, please email [iarla@quartzpay.io](mailto:iarla@quartzpay.io)
