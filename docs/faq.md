# ‚ùî FAQ

| What makes Quartz different?
| :-
| Other crypto cards and finance apps require you to sell your crypto to pay for expenses. Quartz lets you stay holding all your investments by paying for transactions through a secured line of credit, backed by your crypto assets. Other lending protocols require you to actively manage your loans to avoid liquidation fees, but Quartz handles all of this for you automatically.

| Where can I use the Quartz card?
| :-
| You can order a virtual or physical Quartz card, which can be used for both in-person and online transactions anywhere Visa is accepted. The card also supports Apple/Google Pay and can be managed in the app and website.

| How does it work?
| :-
| You can find out all the information about our secured line of credit, DeFi loans, liquidation protection, and everything else about the Quartz protocol [here](./how-it-works).

| Have you guys taken part in any hackathons?
| :-
| Yes! We won 5th place in Payments for the Colosseum Radar hackathon, the largest hackathon in crypto history. We also won 3rd place in Mercuryo's "Best Consumer Use Cases" hackathon.

| What's your pricing?
| :-
| Quartz currently takes no fees. We don't charge any spend, top-up, maintenance, or hidden fees. There is a 1.5% + $0.30 foreign exchange fee on non-USD card transactions, which we pass on from our card-issuing partner.

| Is there KYC?
| :-
| While the Quartz protocol can be used by anyone permissionlessly, regulation requires that the card is only used by users who pass KYC verification.

| When is Quartz launching?
| :-
| Our private beta is available to select members of your early-access Discord community, with more spaces available as we update the product. There are a limited number of spots, so join the [waitlist](https://quartzpay.io/) to secure yours!
