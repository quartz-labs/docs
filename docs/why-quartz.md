# ðŸ’¡ Why Quartz?


## With Quartz, you get:

- Self-custody debit card and bank transfers, without selling your assets

- Highest yield rate on all deposits

- Lowest interest rate DeFi loans

- No liquidation fees, and notifications when collateral is auto-repaid


## Main Features

### Self-custody debit card

Quartz users are provided with a self-custody debit card, which they can manage and spend with through the Quartz mobile app. The balance for this card is kept on crypto, and stored in the Quartz platform. Only the wallet that deposited the funds can withdraw or spend them, no one else has access to your balance (not even Quartz).

When you want to spend with your debit card, you must first authorize the transaction in the Quartz app. This gives Quartz access to the specific amount of funds required to cover the transaction and opens the virtual debit card to pay with. Quartz then takes out a DeFi loan against those funds, so you can spend their value without selling them.

### Aggregation

Quartz aggregates lending providers across Solana DeFi, so you always get the best yield and interest rates. Quartz will automatically move your loan between lending providers to get the lowest available rate, without any manual input required by you. Quartz is only able to move your funds between protocols, and can never withdraw them out of the platform without your authorization. Quartz currently integrates the following protocols, with more coming soon:

- [Drift](https://www.drift.trade/)
- [MarginFi](https://www.marginfi.com/)

### Auto-Repay

Each lending protocol has a liquidation threshold, which is the maximum loan amount you can take out against your deposited collateral. When depositing with lending protocols directly, your collateral will be liquidated and you'll pay a fee if your loan reaches this threshold. With Quartz, your loan will automatically be repaid using your collateral at market rate if it gets close to this threshold. Because it is repaid before reaching this threshold, you don't have to pay the typical liquidation fee (usually 5% of the collateral required to cover the loan).

### Yield

All deposits are automatically deposited into integrated DeFi protocols to earn yield. Any yield left over after paying the interest on outstanding loans is paid directly into your Quartz account.
