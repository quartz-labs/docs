# ðŸ’¡ Why Quartz?


## With Quartz, you get:

- Self-custody debit card, without selling your assets

- Highest available yield rate on all funds

- Lowest interest rate DeFi loans

- No liquidation fees, and notifications when collateral is auto-repaid


## Main Features

### Self-Custody Debit Card

Quartz users are provided with a self-custody debit card, which they can manage and spend with through the Quartz mobile app and website. The balance for this card is kept in crypto, and stored in the Quartz platform. Only the wallet that originally added the funds can withdraw or spend them, no one else has access to your balance (not even Quartz).

You can set daily, weekly, monthly, or yearly spend limits, which gives Quartz access to the specific amount of funds required to cover your transactions. Quartz then takes out a DeFi loan against those assets, so you can spend their value without selling them.

### Yield

Through our [Lulo](https://lulo.fi/) integration, all funds are automatically routed to whichever DeFi protocol has the highest available yield. Any yield left over after paying the interest on outstanding loans is paid directly into your Quartz account. Quartz and Lulo are only able to move your funds between protocols, and can never withdraw them out of the platform without your authorization.

### Auto-Repay

Each lending protocol has a liquidation threshold, which is the maximum loan amount you can take out against your collateral. If your loan reaches this threshold when taking out loans with lending protocols directly, your collateral will be liquidated and you'll pay a fee. With Quartz, however, your loan will automatically be repaid using your collateral at market rate if your account reaches 0% health. Because it is repaid before reaching the underlying protocol's threshold, you don't have to pay the typical liquidation fee (usually 5% of the collateral required to cover the loan).
