# 🛡️ Audits

Quartz only integrates with audited protocols.

Here are the audits that have been completed for the protocols that Quartz integrates with:

- [Drift](https://docs.drift.trade/security/audits)
- [MarginFi](https://docs.marginfi.com/mfi-v2#security)

The Quartz smart contract itself will be audited in due course.
