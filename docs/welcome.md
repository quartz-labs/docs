# ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to Quartz

Spend your crypto's value, **without selling**.

<br/>

## What is Quartz?

Quartz is DeFi protocol that lets you spend the value of your crypto assets without selling them, through bank transfers and a self-custody debit card.

Instead of selling, Quartz takes out a DeFi loan against your assets and off-ramps that whenever you tap your card or make a bank transfer. The interest on the loan is then paid off with the yield generated by your deposits, and when you decide to sell at some point in the future it combines it all into one transaction.

Quartz aggregates lending providers across Solana DeFi to give you the best rate when you take out a loan, and automatically moves your deposits if a better interest rate becomes available, without any manual work from you.

Unlike other lending providers, Quartz loans are protected from loan liquidations. If your loan's approaches the maximum withdraw value allowed, Quartz will automatically repay your loan using your collateral at market rate. This means you don't have to worry about paying the typical liquidation fee (usually 5% of the collateral).

Your funds stay on-chain and in your custody at all times, so Quartz has no access to your funds without your authorization.
