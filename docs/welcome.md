# ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to Quartz

### 

Spend your crypto's value **without selling it**.


## What is Quartz?

Quartz is the best way to spend your crypto's value without selling it.

Quartz gives you the lowest interest rate loan on your crypto's value. It finds the lowest interest rate loan across Solana DeFi and automatically moves your deposits for you to have the lowest payments, without any manual work.

Quartz loans are also protected from loan liquidations. If your loans LTV is getting close to the liquidation threshold, Quartz will automatically sell your collateral to bring it back down to a safe level. This means you don't have to worry about losing the typical 5% liquidation penalty.

You can then use the borrowed funds to buy food, pay for services, or anything else you want using our built in off-ramp and debit card.

### With Quartz, you get:

- Lowest Interest Rate Loans

- No Liquidation Fees

- Highest APY on non-collateral deposits

- Built in off-ramp
