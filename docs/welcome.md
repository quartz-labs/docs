# ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to Quartz

Spend your crypto's value, **without selling**.

<br/>

## What is Quartz?

Quartz is a DeFi protocol that lets you spend the value of your crypto assets without selling them through a self-custody debit card.

Instead of selling, Quartz takes out a DeFi loan against your assets to cover the transaction whenever you pay with your card. With traditional crypto cards, you have to sell your investments for stablecoins or fiat in order to spend, but Quartz lets you stay holding. Since you don't sell, you keep all the gain if your assets go up in value.

Unlike other DeFi lending providers, Quartz loans are protected from liquidation fees (usually up to 10%). If your assets drop too low in value, they are automatically sold at market rate to pay off your loan. All deposit on Quartz earn the best available DeFi yield, powered by [Lulo](https://lulo.fi/) - which automatically routes your funds to the highest yield protocol at regular intervals.

Your funds stay on-chain and in your custody at all times, so Quartz has no access to your funds without your authorization.

Quartz is currently in private beta, join our [waitlist](https://quartzpay.io/) to learn more about our early-access community.
